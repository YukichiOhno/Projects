                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Joshinko glutinous rice flour</li>
                    <li>Shiratamako glutinous sweet rice flour</li>
                    <li>Powdered sugar</li>
                    <li>Hot water</li>
                    <li>Matcha powder</li>
                    <li>Pink food coloring</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>First, soak the 12 bamboo skewers in water.</li>
                    <li>Place the rice flours into a bowl and then pour in the hot water. Begin mixing with a spoon, and then when it starts to take shape, use your hands to mold the dango dough together. Add a little more flour or water if needed. The dough should feel like clay or play-doh, but softer.</li>
                    <li>Evenly divide the dango dough into three pieces. Place each one into a separate bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add 1 drop of pink food coloring to one piece of dough and work it in until there is no more white.</li>
                    <li>Now add 1 teaspoon of water to the matcha powder and mix to make a paste. Then add it to another piece of dough and work it in well. The last piece of dough should remain white.</li>
                    <li>Shape the dough into balls. Begin shaping the dough into balls. Each ball should be 20 grams, weighed on a kitchen scale. The recipe makes about 36 balls.</li>
                    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil and begin cooking the white balls first. Once they rise to the top of the pot, continue cooking them for another 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to transfer the steamed dango to a bowl of ice water.</li>
                    <li> Continue this process with the pink and then the green dango to avoid staining the water. </li>
                    <li>Place the balls on the bamboo skewers, making sure to place the green ones on first, then the white, and the pink ones last. Serve as they are or add a topping.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Vegetable oil, or canola oil, for deep-frying </li>
                    <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter </li>
                    <li>1 cup water </li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt </li>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour </li>
                    <li>4 large eggs </li>

                <ol>
                    <li> Fill a deep pot with 2 inches of oil and heat to 375 F. </li>
                    <li> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter in the water over medium-high heat. </li>
                    <li> Add salt and flour, and quickly stir until a sticky batter is formed. Remove from heat. </li>
                    <li> Beat in the eggs, 1 egg at a time, until the batter is smooth. </li>
                    <li> Fry mounded teaspoons of dough, several at a time, for about 6 minutes or until light, golden brown on each side. Don't crowd the fryer; ensure each beignet has plenty of room to move around. They may flip over by themselves, or you can use a slotted spoon to flip them so they cook evenly on all sides. </li>
                    <li> Drain the beignets for a few minutes on a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. </li>
                    <li> Dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve warm and enjoy. </li>
