                    <li>While the chilies are heating, bring a medium pot with 3 cups of water to a simmer and remove from heat. Once the chiles have softened, add the chiles to the pot hot water and cover. Let the chiles soak in the hot water for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat a tablespoon or two of olive oil (enough to coat the bottom of the pan) in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Pat the pork pieces dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them generously with salt.</li>
                    <li>Working in batches, taking care not to crowd the pan or stir the meat much, brown the meat on all sides.</li>

                    <li>Right at the end of browning the meat, add 4 cloves of roughly chopped garlic to the pan with the meat, let cook with the meat for about a minute.</li>
                    <li>Once the meat has browned, transfer it to the large stockpot of boiling water. Scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan, and any garlic, and add those to the pot as well. Add the rinsed hominy.</li>
                    <li>Add bay leaves, cumin, and oregano. When you put the oregano in, smoosh together with your hands so that the oregano breaks up more as it goes in. Add a tablespoons of salt. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat and cook for 15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>by puréeing in a blender the chilies, 2 1/2 cups or so of their soaking liquid, a teaspoon of salt, and 4 cloves of garlic. (To prevent the blender from creating too much pressure, it's probably best to start with the chiles and garlic and only a cup of the liquid in the blender, and then adding the rest of the liquid.)</li>
                    <li>Strain the red sauce through a sieve, discarding the tough bits of the sauce.</li>

                    <li>Add another couple teaspoons of salt. Return to a simmer, lower the heat to just high enough to maintain a simmer, partially covered.</li>
                    <li>Skim away excess fat. Taste for seasoning and add more salt to taste (you will likely need more than you expect, perhaps a tablespoon or more.) The resulting soup should be rather brothy, as you will be adding a lot garnishes. Add more water if necessary.</li>
                    <li>When getting ready to serve the pozole, you can prep the garnishes (slice the cabbage, chop the cilantro, etc.). To serve, arrange the garnishes in bowls on the table and serve the pozole soup into bowls. Let your guests pick and choose which garnishes they would like on their pozole.</li>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 batch Super Simple Marinara Sauce, or 2 cups (16 ounces) store-bought marinara</li>
                    <li>2 medium eggplants (about 2 ¼ pounds total) </li>
                    <li>1/4 cup + 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt, more to taste</li>
                    <li>8 ounces rigatoni, ziti or spaghetti</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil, plus a handful more small basil leaves or torn leaves for garnish </li>
                    <li>1/2 to 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, to taste (optional)</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>3/4 cup (1.5 ounces) finely grated ricotta salata and/or Parmesan cheese</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>If making your own marinara: Cook the sauce per instructions. If it’s done cooking before you’re ready to assemble, cover the pot and keep it warm over very low heat. If youre using store-bought marinara, warm it in a pot over medium-low heat while you cook the pasta. </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit with racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two large, rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper for easy cleanup.</li>
                    <li>Use a vegetable peeler to shave off long alternating strips of eggplant peel. The eggplants will look striped like zebras when you’re done. Then slice the eggplants into ½-inch thick rounds, discarding the end pieces. </li>
                    <li>Place the eggplant on the lined baking sheets. Brush the rounds with olive oil on both sides. Sprinkle the eggplant with the salt and plenty of pepper. Roast until deeply golden and tender, about 35 to 45 minutes, flipping after 20 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta until al dente, according to package directions. Reserve some pasta cooking water before draining (about ½ cup should be plenty), then return the pasta to the pot.</li>
                    <li>When the eggplant is done and the marinara is finished cooking (or warmed through, if using store-bought), gently stir the roasted eggplant into the sauce. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil, fresh basil, red pepper flakes (skip if you don’t like spice, or load it up if you do). Crush the dried oregano between your fingers as you drop it in.</li>
                    <li>Add the pasta to the sauce with a couple tablespoons of the reserved pasta cooking water, and gently stir it in. Add about two-thirds of the cheese, reserving the rest for garnish. Season to taste with additional salt (I usually add ¼ teaspoon more) and black pepper. You can add a bit more of the reserved pasta cooking water to loosen up the sauce, if desired.</li>
                    <li>Divide the pasta between four bowls. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the individual servings, followed by some extra fresh basil. For added richness, drizzle the servings lightly with olive oil. Enjoy! Leftover pasta will keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for 4 to 5 days.</li>

                    <li>1 tbsp white wine</li>
                    <li>6 ml soy sauce</li>
                    <li>9 ml Japanese rice wine</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start with preparing the sauce. Peel the onions and the carrots, and remove the seeds from the peppers. Chop the vegetables into small pieces.</li>
                    <li>Sauté the vegetables shortly. Then, add white wine, tomato juice, tomato ketchup, chicken stock cube, and sugar.</li>
                    <li>Dissolve the kudzu in a little bit of water. Instead of kudzu, you can also thicken the vegetable sauce with a roux: simply melt the butter in a small saucepan, and stir in wheat flour. Fry the roux shortly, and set aside.</li>
                    <li>When the vegetable sauce starts boiling, add the roux or kudzu. This way, the sauce will become thick. Season with salt and pepper to taste – if the tomato juice is salted, adding salt may not be necessary. Set the sauce aside.</li>
                    <li>Now, prepare the omurice filling. Cut the chicken thighs into small, 1-cm cubes. Pre-boil pak choi. Chop the onions and the shiitake finely. Whisk the eggs. In a small bowl, mix the ingredients for seasoning (white wine, soy sauce, and rice wine).</li>
                    <li>In a large frying pan, warm up 1 tbsp of cooking oil and quickly fry the chicken. Drizzle with a little bit of whisked eggs – this will soak up excess liquid. Add shiitake and onion and stir-fry over medium heat. Stir in cooked rice, boiled pak choi, salt, pepper, and some of the seasoning sauce. Finally, add ketchup, stir again, and remove from heat.</li>
                    <li>Next, fry the eggs. Prepare another large frying pan and heat some cooking oil in it. Pour in whisked eggs – usually, two whisked eggs make one serving. Stir the eggs with chopsticks until they are halfway cooked. Then, put 1/4 of the filling into the middle of the omelet, flatten out, and turn off the heat.</li>
                    <li>Finally, fold the omurice: fold the sides of the omelet so they partially cover the filling. Tilt the frying pan and the serving plate, so they form a letter V. Slowly slide the omurice onto the plate, turning it over simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with some vegetable sauce and serve.</li>

                    <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Before you begin, prepare the meat and vegetables for stir frying. Peel the ginger with either a vegetable peeler or the side of a spoon and then grate it with a cheese grater. Peel and grate the carrots with a large holed cheese grater. Remove the core from the cabbage and cut into thin strips. Slice the onion into thin strips. Cut the broccoli into bite-sized pieces. Slice the chicken into thin strips.</li>
                    <li>Begin boiling a medium pot full of water for the noodles. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the grated ginger, saute for about 30 seconds to one minute (its okay if it sticks to the pan but don’t let it burn). Add the chicken strips and cook until they are no longer pink (about five minutes).</li>
                    <li>Once the chicken is cooked through, add all of the vegetables. Stir and cook until wilted (about 5-10 minutes). Meanwhile, once the water boils, add the noodles and cook just until tender (2-3 minutes). Drain, return to the pot (with the heat turned off) and toss with the sesame oil to keep from sticking.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sriracha, and sugar. Use only 1/2 tsp of sriracha if you don’t want it spicy, use up to 1 Tbsp if you like it hot. Stir until the ketchup and sugar are dissolved. Pour the sauce into the skillet with the chicken and vegetables with the heat still on medium high. Add the noodles, stir to coat everything in the sauce, and heat through (just a few minutes).</li>
